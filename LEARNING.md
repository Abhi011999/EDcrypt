## Some steps that I took while writing Rust code

1. Logged-in to Heroku
2. Installed "api" plugin
3. Got 200 OK GET response
4. Tested the API
5. Installed RUST
6. Some getting started material from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
7. Learned about constants from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/constants.html).
8. Reading a file in rust from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-02-reading-a-file.html).
9. Learning the concept behind unwrap function from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36362020/what-is-unwrap-in-rust-and-what-is-it-used-for).
10. Took a little insight about strings from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24158114/what-are-the-differences-between-rusts-string-and-str?rq=1).
11. Learning about serde, a serialization and deserialization library of rust from [here](https://docs.rs/serde/1.0.133/serde/trait.Deserialize.html)
12. Learning about reqwest, a http request library from [here](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/).
13. Learning about tokio, an async library from [here](https://crates.io/crates/tokio).
14. Did some debugging by adding print lines between code.
15. Finally its working!
